Oh, my child...
I'm not sure how suitable this time is, but...
The person in this statue is Noctis, our prophet, you know that too...
Our family is from his lineage, you know this too...
What you don't know is that why is he a prophet...
The reason was his love that ended in death, Gratias...
God Capra chose him for this reason...
I love you too, Gratias...
