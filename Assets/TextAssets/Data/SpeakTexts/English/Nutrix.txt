Gratias Can you full the Heart Imitator in the living room and then come to the kitchen?

Sleeping won't save your lifes boys, come, eat and go to work now!
I'm still waiting...
Ah, welcome Gratias. Sweetheart, come and sit down, we have some topics to discuss with your siblings...
I love you son!
Ah,
yes,
my darlings,
I have some bad news for you.
No, we've been discussing how do we say it, with  Gratias, for a while now,
and it seems the easiest way to explain it is to keep it short.
Gratias is going.
No, you can't Zam.
Perhaps you know, Alba Magna is going through a difficult time right now,
and they will also take your sibling
because he is over 14 years old.
he has 12 days left.
I'm sorry...
Shut up Tomthegy!
I will talk with you now.
Privatly...
You can go Gratias.
Take the sickle in outside and work on the farm for a while...
Gratias, sweetheart, could you come to the kitchen?
Graty, Do You know anyone called Nakah?
Someone named Nakah has left a letter at our door for you.
I don't know who he is either, I haven't read the letter, but there's a blue kiss on it.
Grat What?
Ok?
Who is the note from?
Oh, okay
Well, actually, I have something to do for you, and these are our last days together.
There are some things I've prepared for your father in the cellar, and I'd like you to come pick them up..
Yes, he's coming because he won't be able to see you for a while.
By the way, I've lost the key to the cellar. Can you find it for me?
I think it was in the imitator, but I'm not sure.
Your sibling was there last; I had given it to her.
It's not exact, but he has a few days, that's what he said.
