You know the gods, they are all special and unique; Mortem, the oldest ones, Hayat, the most mysterious ones, Shizen, the best ones... But what about Fire, also known as Capra? Who was he? The youngest one. And why? Here comes King Capra and his son Nigreos. In fact, Fire, the deity of Caprum Ruen, initially belonged to King Capra. Capra was one of the oldest and therefore most powerful gods of his era. Due to being a pinnacle Ruen in the upper realms of Caprum Ruen, Capra had a vast domain, and due to his age, he was particularly active in the Orbis region. Hayat was the one who benefited the most from his presence. However, Capra decided to exert his influence beyond the Ruen universe during a lunar alignment. When he ventured outside of Ruen, he traveled throughout Orbis, gathering a wealth of knowledge. However, when the lunar alignment ended, a fragment remained outside. A Ruen filled entirely with Fire began to roam Orbis, and one day it fell into the hands of a woman. When the Fire-filled Ruen merged with the woman's Copy Ruen, it became lifeless but transformed into a being outside of Ruen, and Nigreos came into existence. The woman was too young to have a child, so everyone was shocked. Her family considered it shameful and cast the girl out of the house.
However, unable to harm the child, the girl's mother came to their aid, and Nigreos grew up in the streets. Being different from other people, his skin was pitch black, which frightened others, but he was a good-hearted person. He was filled with kindness. Within a year of his birth, he grew so rapidly that he appeared larger than his own mother. However, one day the girl's father discovered this and went to kill the child. In the process, he unintentionally killed the girl's mother first, slashing her throat with an axe. Witnessing this, Nigreos became consumed with anger and pounced on his father. He tore him apart and began devouring him. His inner rage and monstrous nature were unleashed. The girl rescued Nigreos from his father's remains, and they were left without a family. Suddenly, a black-robed, elderly man who had been observing the events approached them and offered to help. He led them to a colossal palace.
He said he could take care of both of them. When asked, he said he had a gift for one of them. They lived there for years, but one day the girl died. Unable to bear the girl's death, Nigreos attempted suicide, but the old man stopped him and locked him in a room to prevent him from harming himself. He kept him there for years. One day, a man entered the room through the door. He was a black-cloaked figure with a goat's head and an armadillo tail. Nigreos was afraid, but he felt a connection to the man. The man told him that he was his father. Nigreos was shocked because he had believed he never had a father. The man said his name was Capra and that he could give Nigreos anything he desired. Nigreos expressed his wish to have his mother back. Capra said he could do that but that Nigreos had to join him first. Nigreos agreed and joined Capra. On the way, he saw the old man's severed head, but he wasn't afraid. Instead, he felt joy. There was a tremendous desire for destruction within him. Capra showed him his mother, but Nigreos felt that she wasn't his real mother. Capra told him that his mother had died and could never return. Nigreos became furious and tried to leave, but his feet were chained. Capra said, "You have no escape now; you belong to me." Nigreos became even angrier. Then Capra showed him his mother's mutilated body. Nigreos lost his mind, broke the chains, and attacked Capra. Capra was surprised, but he knew it wouldn't affect him. Capra locked him in a water-filled prison and ensured he drowned forever. Millennia passed, and one day condensation formed on the prison's window. It told him to dive deep. He met someone in the depths. They had fair skin and hair. They were beautiful. They revealed all the truths to him.
His father, the gods. It took centuries to narrate, but when it was over, Nigreos was reborn with an eternal anger that would never subside. He had come to understand how repulsive of a being his father was. The girl from the depths told him to wait a few more years and that they would destroy his father. A few more years passed, and Hayat launched a terrifying attack on Capra. She had enlisted the help of the Giant Eagle Ruin. It wasn't really an attack, but Capra was brought to the brink of annihilation. Seizing the opportunity, Nigreos escaped and killed Capra, subjecting him to eternal torment. Nigreos seized the Fire and became the new heir. However, he didn't realize that the girl from the depths was actually Hayat herself. Nigreos was horrified. The one person he loved and spent years together had betrayed him. With the power of the Fire Ruin, he gave everything and saved the Fire. And now, Nigreos became the new King, the new Capra. The Fire now possessed a realm and power comparable to Hayat's, but at least it continued to exist.
