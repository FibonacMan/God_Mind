Our story begins with a love affair between Noctis and Albarose. During their time, as Noctis' people fought wars, the people of Alta Magna and Albarose's people from Alba Magna conversed with each other and experienced love at Magna Lake, but they could never touch each other. However, one day, Noctis decided to join a major assault on Alta Magna with his father. During the attack, Noctis escaped and went to Albarose. Albarose wanted to give him a very special gift. She gave him a rare and valuable rose from Alba Magna, unaware of one thing: Capra was watching them. Their love was incredibly strong, and Capra took pleasure in the darkness that would arise in its absence. When Noctis returned home, he couldn't sleep due to the happiness within him, but eventually, he managed to fall asleep while embracing the rose. All he could think of was Albarose's fair skin, beautiful blue eyes, and golden hair. In his dreams, he saw Albarose as clear as day, as if she was right beside him. Suddenly, flames engulfed the surroundings. Noctis' heart sank as his father's sword hanging above the bed was consumed by the flames. Noctis died in agony, unable to move. However, he was content. At least he had held the hand of the woman he loved, caressed her hair, and smelled her skin. At that moment, his father was outside the house, chopping wood. When he returned, he saw his son's screams and smiling face, and his lungs were torn apart. He rushed to save him, but he watched his son turn to ashes before he could rescue him. Months passed, and the girl hadn't seen her child for months. She was starting to forget his face. She spent her entire day by the lake, waiting for him to appear from the other side. Every night. She didn't sleep for days, but she never saw him. A year went by, and she couldn't bear Noctis' absence anymore. She set out on a boat across the lake. Her aim was to reach the other side, but a storm started before she could get there. The storm flipped the boat, but it didn't sink completely. The girl could still breathe, but she couldn't escape. She pounded on the planks for hours, trying to free herself, but she couldn't succeed. Yet, she wasn't saddened. A world without her loved one was worse than death for her. She let herself sink into the water and waited until she drowned from hunger and exhaustion. The pain and sorrow had consumed each other. Love had driven them to death. However, a glimmer of hope appeared before them. Fire gave Noctis a glimpse of hope—to see his beloved once again. Noctis clung to this hope. Life gave Albarose a chance—to touch Noctis once more. Albarose embraced this hope. And the prophets were resurrected.
