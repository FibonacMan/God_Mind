The character is the son of the sons of the sons of the Messenger of Fire years later. Because he is blood related to Noctis, the Messenger of Fire, and Fire is Prone to Chain Link, many of his attributes have remained constant. One of them is that the Fire Blood Shard is huge. In this way, he is very prone to becoming a god or a messenger. But his family and society do not like Noctis. Because the region where Noctis lived in the war with Ferruguine was badly damaged. Therefore, his family is ostracized by society. Our character Gratias has been listening to people for years how bad and crazy Noctis is. While our character lives his life happily, his life changes radically because of another Fire people who went to war with his country. These Fire folk have not been harmed by Noctis and therefore love Noctis. Gratias participates in this war by necessity because his country has entered a collective war and he sends every male adult to the battlefield. After months of fighting on the battlefield, Gratias encounters one of the enemy soldiers on the battlefield. This person is a former Noctis slave named Blasphemare. Blasphemare shows him that his life could actually be very different, turning him into a murderous monster who will do anything to become a god. At the end of the story, when he was about to become a god, Blasphemare stabs him in the back and kills him and becomes a god. Gratias disappears.
